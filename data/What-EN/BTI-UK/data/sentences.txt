In the distance, a couple walk their dog along an urban beach. They pass a jogger running in the opposite direction. The dog stops to sniff at something on the sand.

###.

Responding to the whistle, he pads after his owners.  Words in black letters on a white background. what happens while, followed by a long black line.

###.

A white saloon pulls up alongside the beach wall. The male driver is on his mobile.

###.

The man in his mid 30's with a sandy beard, sighs with annoyance.

###.

Wearing a work suit, his tie loosened at the collar, he puts on a pair of sunglasses.

###.

In white letters, JAMES,the business man. James walks along the promenade with a beach bag over his shoulder.

###.

Having taken off his suit, James lies back on a thin towel on the sand.

###.

He runs his hands across his eyes, then lets them drop by his side.

###.

He lets the sand trickle through his fingers.

###.

He sits up to answer the phone.

###.

He looks round for the source of the sound.

###.

He gets to his feet and walks along the sand in his trunks. In the distance, the city of Barcelona is a hazy outline.

###.

He looks towards the top of the beach and then turns to face the sea, puzzled by the high pitched whine.

###.

He walks down to the edge of the water, then turns back up the beach to where he left his clothes,

###.

He puts on his blue shirt, his eyes scouring the sky for the source of the sound.

###.

With his suit back on, but no tie, he walks under a canopy of trees still looking puzzled.

###.

He clambers up a sandy pathway to the top of a steep rocky slope

###.

A middle aged man with unkempt grey hair, heavy brows and a bristly beard taps his coffee cup in his fingers. He wears a green vest and a chain around his neck. His eyes follow a flight of birds and a smile comes to his lips.  He has a tatoo on his upper arm and a chain bracelet on one wrist. He taps the lid of the cup and lifts it. 

###.

He peers at the half full cup of coffee and takes a sip.

###.

In white letters: RICK, the retiree. He is sitting on a bench beneath some trees in full leaf. He puts the lid on the seat next to him and stares at the coffee, his right knee jigging up and down. He drinks up, then puts the cup next to the lid and leans back, clapping his hands.

###.

He reaches in the the back pocket of his trousers and pulls out his mobile phone.

###.

He scrolls through his contact list.

###.

He finds one, taps on the green ring icon and puts the phone to his ear.

###.

He hears the high pitched sound.

###.

Rick gets up, pockets his phone and wanders off leaving the coffee cup on the park seat. He looks up at the sky, trying to locate the source of the sound as he goes.  A girl with ringletted auburn hair, heaves a sigh and chews on her pencil.

###.

In white letters: JESS, the student.

###.

Sitting at her apple laptop, Jess fishes about for her phone.

###.

She rings off, perplexed by the sound,

###.

She looks about her.

###.

Wearing a hooded jacket, she goes outside.

###.

She climbs an overgrown slope, the sunlight reflected on her long ringlets

###.

She scampers off out of view

###.

She runs out onto a sun-bleached beach, where Rick and James are looking about them, in puzzlement.

###.

A disembodied voice.

###.

Rick shrugs his shoulder and shakes his head. Jess shakes HER head

###.

James smiles doubtfully.

###.

As James strolls off, Rick catches up with him. Jess considers,

###.

With a smile, she follows them and all three walk off together.

###.

A young black woman is on the phone as she sorts through her washing.

###.

No I coudn't, I have to finish, really. No, what are you talking about? Ofcourse yes, our luggage is ready.

###.

She looks up towards the sound.,

###.

Listen, I can't talk right now, I have to leave you.

###.

In white capitals, Zoe, the next one,
