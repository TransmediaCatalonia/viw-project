A nearly-empty beach beside a sea. A couple wears jackets as they stroll with their large Great Dane.

###.

A male runner jogs past. The dog trots and sniffs the sand. It follows its owner along the coast.

###.

Words appear: What Happens While… with a long, blank line at the end.

###.

A slick, white car approaches, driving on the grey asphalt. The male driver sits alone inside and speaks on his cell phone.

###.

He looks aggressive as he bangs the steering wheel. He gets out. He wears a business suit.

###.

He grabs items from the trunk.

###.

He mutters and stares disdainfully at the phone as he hangs up.

###.

His pale skin looks cool and soft in the muted sunlight.

###.

He puts on dark aviator, sunglasses.

###.

Words appear: James, the Businessman

###.

He walks along the nearly empty beach carrying a beach bag. He makes a call.

###.

Now, James lies back, bare-chested, on a towel in the sand. His brownish, stubbly beard and chest hair almost match the ground.

###.

He exhales hard, then rubs his closed eyes. He stays up by the setled sunlight and gently moves his fingrers through the sand.

###.

He sits up.

###.

He looks left...and right.

###.

He looks at the sand around him.

###.

James gazes around, looking confused. He stands up, wearing his boxer shorts on the secluded beach. 

###.

He walks along the water's edge.

###.

He suddenly turns to the left and looks as if he's following the sound. A city's skyscrapers rise in the distant coast.

###.

He pauses, then starts back toward his towel in the sand.

###.

He turns again toward the sound.

###.

He wanders closer to the waves along the shore. James looks puzzled, and peers around the beach.

###.

The sky is hazy-white, without distinguishable clouds or sun. James walks away from the water, scanning around with his eyes, as if trying to locate the mysterious sound.

###.

Standing at his towel in the sand, he grabs his shirt and begins to put it on. He furrows his brow, looking inquisitively at the air.

###.

Now, James wears his suit and walks under large, leafy trees.

###.

His unsmiling, serious face stares forward.

###.

James climbs a dirt trail, up a mountain covered in short, dense bushes and cactuses.

###.

Now, fingers lightly tap on a to-go coffee cup.

###.

An unshaven older man with messy, longish, grey hair gazes around, looking bored.

###.

He stares down at his hands and the coffee cup, circling his fingers around the plastic lid.

###.

He removes the lid and raises the black coffee to his mouth.

###.

The man hesitates, then gulps from the small cup.

###.

His eyes look moist and glassy.

###.

Words appear: Rick, the Retiree.

###.

Rick sits at a park bench. His right leg twitches, bouncing up and down in tiny movements.

###.

He sits alone and takes another sip of his coffee.

###.

He sets his cup on another bench.

###.

He stares up at the trees and looks restless as he claps his hands.

###.

Rick scrolls through the many contacts on his smart phone.

###.

He pauses on the ""C"" names.

###.

He selects a contact named ""Craig Anderson.""

###.

He darts his eyes up curiously.

###.

Rick stares around, looking pensive.

###.

Rick wanders off along a park trail, leaving his coffee cup on a bench.

###.

Rick wears a loose, green tank-top and jeans. He looks up and turns around, as if he's scanning for the sound.

###.

Now, a young woman looks tired and gazes at an open laptop.

###.

She bites on the end of a pencil. Words appear: Jess, the Student.

###.

She fumbles around the desk, searching for her phone.

###.

She lifts papers and find the phone.

###.

Jess answers.

###.

Jess glances around the room. She peers left...and right. She touches her thick, curly, brown hair.

###.

She stares into the silence, looking puzzled.

###.

She jolts up.

###.

Now, outside, Jess hikes up a hill. Tall grass and plants cover the ground. Jess wears a coat and walks around, scanning with her eyes. The sun shines off the greenery. She stops and stares. Then, she continues hiking up.

###.

Now, Rick, James, and Jess gather together in a bright, sandy clearing.

###.

Rick points to his ear.

###.

The three stand on the empty, sun-bleached ground, looking bewildered.

###.

They look everywhere, as if trying to find the source of the voice.

###.

James' face looks panicked.

###.

Rick grips his head with one hand.

###.

Rick nods.

###.

James quickly peers at Rick. Rick shrugs and shakes his head. Rick looks at Jess.

###.

James smiles with closed lips.

###.

Rick follows James across the pebbly ground.

###.

Jess looks down and smiles thoughtfully. She glances at the other two, then quickly runs to them. She walks between James and Rick. James softly places his arm around her shoulder. The three walk together across the dusty ground, heading toward the leafy plants and gentle mountain. The image disappears to a black screen.

###.

Now, a woman speaks on a cell.

###.

Subtitles: No, I couldn't. I have to finish, really.

###.

She gazes up. No! What are you talking about? Of course yes, our luggage is ready…

###.

The woman furrows her brow. She looks around again. Listen, I cannot talk right now. I have to leave you.

###.

Words appear: Zoé, the Next One.

###.

A title: What Happens While... with a long, blank line at the end.
