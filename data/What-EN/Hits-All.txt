BridgeM-US.eaf	509000	525070	Now, outside, Jess hikes up a hill. Tall grass and plants cover the ground. Jess wears a coat and walks around, scanning with her eyes. The sun shines off the greenery. She stops and stares. Then, she continues hiking up.

BridgeM-US.eaf	736920	756080	Jess looks down and smiles thoughtfully. She glances at the other two, then quickly runs to them. She walks between James and Rick.

What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	94090	97150	Bare-chested down on the beach, he flops onto a towel.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	100030	106850	Closing his eyes, he rubs his face wearily, then runs his left hand over the sand, letting some of it trickle through his fingers.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	141850	143340	He looks around in confusion.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	158120	169450	Dropping his phone, he gets up and walks along the seashore in his swimming trunks, scanning his surroundings for the source of the sound. Behind him, city buildings across the water blur against the hazy horizon.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	179000	181200	James turns back towards his towel.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	188100	193380	Walking back towards the ocean, he looks around him again with an increasingly puzzled expression.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	199230	207890	Heading back up the beach, he returns to his belongings and picks up his grey business shirt, still looking around in confusion as he pulls the sleeves over his arms.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	219560	227500	Dressed in his suit again, James strolls down the promenade and scrambles up a sandy embankment overgrown with dry shrubs, grasses and cacti.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	234010	242040	Two hands holding a takeaway coffee cup. They belong to a thick-set man with a greying beard and fuzzy grey hair. His large eyes look about him.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	250140	256160	He taps the lid of his coffee cup before taking it off and smelling the black coffee. He sips it with a look of resignation.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	266190	282260	Rick - the retiree. He's sitting on a park bench in dappled shade, wearing an olive-green vest that exposes the chain around his neck and the tattoos on his arm. He taps his right leg restlessly as he takes another sip of coffee, then he puts the cup aside and claps his hands aimlessly.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	287000	293540	Taking a phone from his back pocket, he searches his list of contacts before choosing the number of someone called Craig Anderson.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	329880	331110	Rick frowns at the sky.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	380270	381280	He frowns again.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	398010	403270	He leaves his coffee behind as he pockets his phone and walks through the park, scanning the air above his head.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	411130	416580	A young woman with springy red-brown curls is studying at her laptop. Jess - the student.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	422710	424370	She searches her cluttered desk.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	428600	429740	She finds her phone.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	494650	497220	Jess looks around her with a puzzled expression.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	511530	531070	Outside, dressed in a warm jacket, jeans and a scarf, Jess scans her surroundings, then climbs up an overgrown hillside with the sun glinting on her long, springy hair. She pauses to look around, then hurries onward. At the top of the ridge is a clearing, where James and Rick are standing on an expanse of sandy dirt. Jess joins them.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	540260	541650	They all look mystified.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	556140	558650	They all look baffled by the disembodied voice.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	594910	595540	He shrugs.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	708140	710090	With a shrug, Rick shakes his head.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	725390	726140	James smiles.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	737630	741010	Rick follows James, but Jess lingers behind, looking pensive.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	743610	751540	She jogs after the others, and James puts his arm around her as she walks between him and Rick back to the overgrown ridge at the edge of the clearing.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	758640	773630	Blackout, then a woman with black dreadlocks hanging washing on a rooftop. She says into her phone, "No, I couldn't. I have to finish, really. No! What are you talking about? Of course yes, our luggage is ready..."
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	774000	782230	Looking about with a frown she says, "Listen, I cannot talk right now. I have to leave you." Onscreen: Zoe, the next one.
What-Ericsson-AU.eaf	784110	785700	'What Happens While...'
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	3190	13060	Daytime. A pale grey seafront. A couple walk their dog along a sandy promenade, passing a jogger going in the opposite direction.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	18130	21050	What happens while.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	24020	31210	A white saloon car pulls up on the seafront and the driver, who is having an animated conversation on his mobile phone, gets out.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	53020	69840	The man looks exasperated then reaches into his inside jacket pocket and pulls out a pair of sunglasses, which he puts on. He's around fifty and has a short trimmed beard. James - the businessman. Now, he's walking along the promenade with a striped bag slung over his shoulder.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	94610	109120	Having taken off his suit James, who is now bare chested, lies down on his back on a towel he has spread out on the beach. He covers his face with his hands, then holds one arm out to his side and trails his fingers across the sand, allowing it to trickle through them.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	158850	166160	James hangs up then stands and walks a little way across the sand, trying to find the source of the pulsing ringing sound.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	170510	179180	He walks away from the shore, but as the sound seems to die out, he turns to head back to his towel and belongings, his suit lying in a crumpled heap.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	186040	192090	When the volume of the sound increases he looks about, perturbed by the strange trilling.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	197730	204680	He heads back to his spot, a frown furrowing his brow, then picks up his work shirt and starts to put it on.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	209600	218740	He keeps a wary eye on his surroundings. Later he is fully dressed and walking along a pavement with trees arcing over it.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	221660	227200	He heads up a steep, rugged slope, trying to track down the source of the sound.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	231820	248740	An unkempt man is holding a takeaway coffee cup in his hands.  He taps the side of the cup then narrows his eyes pensively before smiling and shaking his head. He's in his sixties, has unruly collar length hair tinged grey at the temples and a salt and pepper beard.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	252300	260040	He lifts the plastic lid off the cup and peers at the dark liquid inside, hesitates then takes a sip.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	262070	265020	Rick - the retiree.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	267650	277159	Rick, who is sitting on a wooden chair in the shade of trees with mishapen trunks, sets down the lid of his cup and jiggles one leg at the knee.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	280050	290220	He puts down his cup then claps his hands before rubbing them together. He takes a smartphone out of his back pocket and starts scrolling down the list of contacts.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	293690	298170	He selects a name, Craig Anderson, then holds his phone to his ear.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	398850	407050	Rick sets off, wearing baggy jeans and a vest, looking intrigued by the strange sound. He leaves his coffee cup behind.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	409960	415900	A curly haired woman sighs and bites the end of a pencil. Jess - the student.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	419000	426100	Distracted by her mobile phone buzzing she searches for it in among the papers scattered around her laptop.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	495810	500170	Jess looks about curiously, then lowers her gaze to her books.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	511160	518169	Giving up on her studies she heads outside to track down the source of the sound, heading up a grassy slope.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	521860	533090	She pauses, then as the shrill sound becomes louder she heads off. She joins James and Rick on an arid patch of land bordered by parched vegetation.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	538940	540910	Jess looks confused.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	556920	560040	The trio can't locate the exact source of the voice.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	708690	711100	Rick shrugs and Jess shakes her head.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	740940	748210	Rick heads after James but Jess lingers for a moment, looking thoughtful, then chuckles to herself before joining them. 
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	751250	756100	James puts his arm around her shoulders for a brief moment, then rubs her back.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	758700	764150	A woman talking on a mobile phone while hanging out washing is distracted by the shrill sound.
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	766580	773150	"No, I couldn't. I have to finish, really. No! What are you talking about? Of course yes, our luggage is ready..."
What-Ericsson-UK.eaf	776410	781160	"Listen, I cannot talk right now. I have to leave you." Zoe  - the next one...
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	4530	15850	It's an early grey morning at an urban seaside. A couple dressed in warm clothes walk their great dane as a lone jogger rambles past. The sidewalk in the foreground that runs alongside a road is vacant.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	19280	21530	A title reads: What happens while BLANK.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	24090	32530	A white two-door coupe pulls up in front of the sidewalk. It's driven by a man in his forties who wears a business suit. Talking on his cell phone, he gets out holding a briefcase.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	43540	44620	He opens his trunk.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	53280	55380	Hanging up, he looks towards the sea.

What-Mennell-CA.eaf	99020	108480	James lies back with his shirt off . He closes his eyes then rubs them. Relaxing his arms to his sides, he runs his fingers through the sand and squints up at the sky.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	115090	115770	 He sits up.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	130170	131350	He glances over his shoulders.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	141870	143590	Then he searches the ground around him.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	158090	174800	He looks inquisitively around his towel then stands and walks towards the water in his black boxer briefs. On the opposite side of the bay, a smokestack looms over a city blurred by the haze. With his back to the cityscape, James walks barefoot in the sand scanning the area.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	180580	183270	Giving up he turns back towards his clothes.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	185320	190310	He pauses then looks searchingly in the direction of the city as he ambles back to the water.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	196230	202470	Then he makes his way to his clothes, still scanning the landscape around him in search of the source of the sound.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	209840	212310	He pulls on his light blue button down shirt.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	219940	223250	Later, with his suit jacket open, he strolls beneath tall trees.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	227110	231200	Then he climbs a well worn dirt path up a slope of cactuses and brush.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	233510	235880	Elsewhere, hands tap a take out coffee cup.

What-Mennell-CA.eaf	245270	246270	He shakes his head.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	249580	251690	He taps his coffee lid before removing it.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	256170	259230	He swirls the dark liquid then takes a swig.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	265260	287440	A title reads: 'Rick: the retiree'.  He places the lid on the park bench beside him then blows on his coffee. His right leg twitches impatiently. Sitting in the shade he wears an army green tank top that exposes his black tattoos on his upper arms. He sets down his coffee then claps his hands impatiently. He grabs a smart phone from his back pocket.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	289850	291040	He scrolls through his contacts.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	294970	298030	Then, settling on "Craig Anderson", he makes a call.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	330260	331440	He squints toward the sky.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	380700	382150	He squints upwards again.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	397390	402330	Leaving his coffee on the bench he scans the sky  before heading off down a gravel path.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	412560	419750	Elsewhere a girl in her early twenties with thick curly red hair sits before a laptop. A title reads: 'Jess, the student.'

What-Mennell-CA.eaf	506360	508350	Hearing the noise again she stands.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	511550	513820	Later outside, she wears a jacket and scarf.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	517900	520250	She hikes up an overgrown grassy slope.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	524780	528810	Her head turns sharply at the sound and she rushes off behind some tall grasses.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	530150	534430	Moments later she joins James and Rick on a sandy plateau atop the hill.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	537440	540530	Standing apart from each other they look around in confusion.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	556000	561470	Searching for the voice; Rick makes a questioning gesture and James shields his eyes from the sun.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	696580	697580	Rick nods.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	708470	710360	Rick shrugs and shakes his head.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	736820	739030	Rick follows James towards the trees.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	740520	743330	Jessica raises her eyebrow then grins.
What-Mennell-CA.eaf	744620	749730	She chases after the men and James puts his arm around her as they fall into step with each other.
