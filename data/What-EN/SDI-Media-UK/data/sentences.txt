A film shot mostly in sombre greys with some colour highlights. Day. A couple stroll along a virtually deserted beach with a large dog lolloping behind them. A man jogs past. 

###.

On a white background: What Happens While.

###.

A BMW coupe pulls up beside the beach and a forty-something guy gets out, speaking on his phone.

###.

He ends the call, then reaches into in his inside jacket pocket.

###.

He takes out sunglasses and puts them on.

###.

James. The businessman. Wearing a suit and carrying a beach bag, James makes a call as he walks.

###.

Now bare chested,James sits on a towel on the beach, then lies back.

###.

Slender,with short, sandy-coloured hair and a neat beard, James rubs his eyes, then , keeping them closed, picks up sand and lets it fall from his fingers.

###.

He sits up.

###.

He scans about.

###.

He throws down his phone and gets up.

###.

Wearing dark-coloured swimming trunks, James walks to the water's edge, then turns back, as if trying to locate the sound. 

###.

He walks through the soft sand, stops and scans about, then returns to the water's edge.

###.

Looking perplexed by the sound, he checks about him. Further round the coast, in the background, the towers and buildings of a power plant fringe the shore.

###.

James' brow is furrowed as he walks back to his belongings on the beach and puts on his shirt. Two small boats bob about in the water behind him.

###.

Dressed again, but minus his tie, James walks past leafy trees.

###.

Walking through scrubland,he climbs a steep, dusty track.

###.

A man holding a plastic cup taps the sides and sniffs. He's in late middle-age with strong features and a grizzled beard. 

###.

Looking bored,the man who has wild, wiry, greying hair runs an index finger around the lid of the cup, then removes it. The cup is half full of clear dark liquid, which he studies before taking a sip.

###.

Rick. The Retiree. Rick, who wears a vest top and a heavy chain around his neck,is sitting on a chair in a sun-dappled area of a park. He jiggles one knee up and down, edgily.

###.

He puts his cup aside and claps his hands.

###.

He takes his phone from a back pocket of his trousers and opens the cover.

###.

Using his index finger, he scrolls through his contacts list to Craig Anderson and calls him.

###.

Hearing the noise, he scans about.

###.

Leaving his cup on a chair, Rick hurries away along a sandy path, scanning above him and about him, following the noise

###.

A young woman.

###.

Jess. The Student. Jess sits chewing a pencil, which she puts down to search for her phone beneath papers on her desk, on which there's also a laptop.

###.

Jess who has long, curly auburn hair scans about her and looks puzzled.

###.

Baffled by the sound,Jess gets up from her desk. Outside,wearing a Parka with a fur-trimmed hood, she looks about her then heads up a slope of tall grasses and scrubby bushes.

###.

She pauses to listen,then disappears into the vegetation.

###.

Jess, Rick and James are standing together.

###.

They're in a sunny, sandy clearing. 

###.

A wind is blowing as they all scan about for the owner of the voice. 

###.

He claps a hand to his head.

###.

They're all standing well apart.

###.

They glance at each other. Rick shrugs and shakes his head.

###.

Rick follows James.Jessica stares down and considers. 

###.

She smiles and runs after them in the sunshine.

###.

They walk off merrily towards trees beneath a clear blue sky.

###.

Blackness.

###.

A woman hangs out washing as she talks on her mobile: No, I couldn't. I have to finish,really. No! What are you talking about? Of course yes, our luggage is ready. Listen, I cannot talk right now. I have to leave you. 

###.

Zoe. The next one
