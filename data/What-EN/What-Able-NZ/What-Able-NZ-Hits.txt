AD-en	3630	14630	11000	On an overcast day, a man and a woman walk by the seaside with a large, lanky dog. A jogger passes them in the opposite direction. The dog pauses to sniff the ground and trots onwards.
AD-en	18850	29580	10730	Black text on a white screen appears, reading: 'What happens while', followed by a long black line. A man in a suit and tie and talking on a cellphone pulls up by the seaside in a white BMW.

AD-en	92680	96770	4090	Later, a shirtless James lies back on his beach towel on the sand.
AD-en	99690	106170	6480	Looking weary, he places his hands on his eyes, then trails his fingers through the pale sand.
AD-en	112620	114630	2010	Frowning, James sits up.
AD-en	142020	143450	1430	He looks distracted.

AD-en	200290	208980	8690	Looking pertured, James continues looking away from the water, his eyes darting. He ambles back to his pile of clothes and puts on his grey business shirt.

AD-en	227200	236340	9140	He slowly makes his way up a steep, craggy slope with dry vegetation. A man taps his finger on a takeaway coffee cup.
AD-en	237420	243410	5990	Wearing a singlet, the man has a greying beard and frizzy hair. He gives a wry smile and looks down.
AD-en	248220	259590	11370	He traces his finger around the white plastic lid, then removes it. Examining the dark liquid contents, he holds the cup to his mouth, pauses, then takes a sip.

AD-en	287560	298090	10530	Taking his phone from his back trouser pocket, Rick scrolls through his contact list. He presses the screen to call Craig Anderson and holds the phone to his ear.
AD-en	330470	332320	1850	Rick looks up, confused.
AD-en	380400	381350	950	Rick frowns.
AD-en	398590	405880	7290	Pocketing his phone, Rick gets up and leaves his takeaway cup on the seat. He casts his eyes skyward as he walks away. A woman with tightly curled brunette hair holds a penci!to her mouth.

AD-en	528216	536189	7973	Jess emerges on to a dry plateau under a cloudless sky where Rick and James stand. James gives a small shrug, and Rick gestures to his ear.

AD-en	557108	561175	4067	James shields his eyes as he looks up into the harsh sunlight.
AD-en	707820	711300	3480	The trio glances at each other, and Rick and Jess shake their heads.

AD-en	743860	748940	5080	She jogs to catch up and falls in line between Rick and James, who put an arm around her shoulders.
AD-en	753300	762240	8940	The trio head off the plateau and towards the scrub. Cut to black. A woman is on the phone while pegging out washing.
AD-en	763170	766400	3230	Subtitles read: No, I couldn't. I have to finish, really.
AD-en	768080	772080	4000	No! What are you talking about? Of course, yes, our luggage is ready.
