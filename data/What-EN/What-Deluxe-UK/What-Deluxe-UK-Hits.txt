AD-en	4000	13120	9120	A road running along by the sea. A couple walk their dog on the flat beach and a jogger runs past. The sky above is pale and dappled with light grey clouds.
AD-en	18550	29210	10660	What happens while. The title ends with just a line. A man parks a sleek white BMW on the road by the sea. Talking on his mobile phone he gets out of the car and opens the boot.
AD-en	52490	62670	10180	The man put a brief case in the boot of the car and took out a stripy cotton bag. He's wearing a suit. He has short light brown hair and a beard. He puts on a pair of aviator style sunglasses.
AD-en	65110	70610	5500	James: The businessman. He walks along with the bag on his shoulder and makes a phone call.
AD-en	93500	97240	3740	Wearing swimming trunks James lies down on a towel on the sandy beach.
AD-en	100050	108530	8480	He relaxes, rubs his eyes and lets his arms flop out to his sides. He gently caresses the sand with his fingers.
AD-en	111680	114240	2560	He sits up and answers his phone.
AD-en	141540	143410	1870	He looks around frowning
AD-en	158140	180580	22440	James hangs up and tosses his phone aside. He's a craggy faced man in his late forties with a slight paunch. He stands up and walks along the sand as waves gently roll in. The coast curves round in the distance with industrial buildings running along it. James stops walking and turns in the other direction. As the strange sound begins again he stops and looks around.
AD-en	192120	199770	7650	Heavy browed James frowns and steps towards the water's edge, he continues to look around as he walks along the sand.
AD-en	207840	211670	3830	James goes back to his things. He picks up his shirt and puts it on.
AD-en	220500	231650	11150	Fully dressed in his suit and with his shirt open James walks along by some trees. He tramps along a track running up a hill between scrubby bushes. Further up are craggy white rocks.
AD-en	235060	256970	21910	A man sits tapping a lidded takeaway coffee cup with his fingers. He wears jeans and a dark green vest. He's about 60 with fine shaggy grey hair and a beard. He shakes his head and lets out a long weary breath. He runs his finger round the coffee cup lid then pulls it off. He holds up the half full cup of black coffee and has a drink.
AD-en	265190	280470	15280	Rick: The Retiree. Rick wears a chain necklace around his neck. He's sitting in the middle of three chairs in a park. He nervously jiggles his right leg up and down, puts the cup on the chair beside him and restlessly claps his hands together.
AD-en	286159	297750	11591	Rick looks agitated. He takes his mobile phone from his back pocket, opens the cover and scans through his contacts. He stops at Craig Anderson, and makes a call.
AD-en	329500	331780	2280	At the sound he looks up and frowns.
AD-en	380260	382000	1740	He looks up again, frowning.
AD-en	399420	411080	11660	Rick leaves the coffee cup on the seat, gets up and walks away, looking around as he goes. A young woman of about twenty sits at a desk typing. She has long red hair that hangs loose in ringlets.
AD-en	412900	414940	2040	She restlessly chews a pencil.
AD-en	417900	419860	1960	Jess: The Student.
AD-en	422540	424260	1720	She searches for her phone.
AD-en	425450	428890	3440	Jess finds her phone under some papers and answers it.
AD-en	494780	498740	3960	Frowning she hangs up and looks around, puzzled by the sound.
AD-en	510120	520600	10480	She gets up and grabs a coat. Wearing her brown parka she walks up a hill. Tall grass and bushes surround her. She keeps looking around as she goes.
AD-en	525950	534920	8970	Jess hurries away. Rick, James and Jess stand in a sandy clearing at the edge of scrubland. They look around in confusion. Rick talks on his phone.
AD-en	556030	560230	4200	Under bright sunshine they all look up, puzzled. A breeze blows around them.
AD-en	594840	596910	2070	Grasping his forehead he shrugs.
AD-en	641700	643140	1440	Rick points at them.
AD-en	696000	697050	1050	Rick nods.
AD-en	700540	701680	1140	James smiles.
AD-en	707190	710930	3740	They consider. Rick shrugs and Jess shakes her head.
AD-en	737010	741160	4150	Rick follows James. Jess thinks for a moment andsmiles to her self.
AD-en	742850	748050	5200	Jess runs over and joins the other two. They walk off together towards the scrubland.
AD-en	758040	759230	1190	The screen cuts to black.
AD-en	763220	782140	18920	A woman talks on her phone as she hangs out washing. She frowns, at the sound. She says: 'No, I couldn't. I have to finish, really. No! What are you talking about? Of course yes, our luggage is ready. Listen, I cannot talk right now. I have to leave you.' She looks increasingly disturbed by the sound: Zoe: The Next One.
