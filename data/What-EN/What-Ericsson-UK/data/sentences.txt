Daytime. A pale grey seafront. A couple walk their dog along a sandy promenade, passing a jogger going in the opposite direction.

###.

What happens while.

###.

A white saloon car pulls up on the seafront and the driver, who is having an animated conversation on his mobile phone, gets out.

###.

The man looks exasperated then reaches into his inside jacket pocket and pulls out a pair of sunglasses, which he puts on. He's around fifty and has a short trimmed beard. James - the businessman. Now, he's walking along the promenade with a striped bag slung over his shoulder.

###.

Having taken off his suit James, who is now bare chested, lies down on his back on a towel he has spread out on the beach. He covers his face with his hands, then holds one arm out to his side and trails his fingers across the sand, allowing it to trickle through them.

###.

James hangs up then stands and walks a little way across the sand, trying to find the source of the pulsing ringing sound.

###.

He walks away from the shore, but as the sound seems to die out, he turns to head back to his towel and belongings, his suit lying in a crumpled heap.

###.

When the volume of the sound increases he looks about, perturbed by the strange trilling.

###.

He heads back to his spot, a frown furrowing his brow, then picks up his work shirt and starts to put it on.

###.

He keeps a wary eye on his surroundings. Later he is fully dressed and walking along a pavement with trees arcing over it.

###.

He heads up a steep, rugged slope, trying to track down the source of the sound.

###.

An unkempt man is holding a takeaway coffee cup in his hands.  He taps the side of the cup then narrows his eyes pensively before smiling and shaking his head. He's in his sixties, has unruly collar length hair tinged grey at the temples and a salt and pepper beard.

###.

He lifts the plastic lid off the cup and peers at the dark liquid inside, hesitates then takes a sip.

###.

Rick - the retiree.

###.

Rick, who is sitting on a wooden chair in the shade of trees with mishapen trunks, sets down the lid of his cup and jiggles one leg at the knee.

###.

He puts down his cup then claps his hands before rubbing them together. He takes a smartphone out of his back pocket and starts scrolling down the list of contacts.

###.

He selects a name, Craig Anderson, then holds his phone to his ear.

###.

Rick sets off, wearing baggy jeans and a vest, looking intrigued by the strange sound. He leaves his coffee cup behind.

###.

A curly haired woman sighs and bites the end of a pencil. Jess - the student.

###.

Distracted by her mobile phone buzzing she searches for it in among the papers scattered around her laptop.

###.

Jess looks about curiously, then lowers her gaze to her books.

###.

Giving up on her studies she heads outside to track down the source of the sound, heading up a grassy slope.

###.

She pauses, then as the shrill sound becomes louder she heads off. She joins James and Rick on an arid patch of land bordered by parched vegetation.

###.

Jess looks confused.

###.

The trio can't locate the exact source of the voice.

###.

Rick shrugs and Jess shakes her head.

###.

Rick heads after James but Jess lingers for a moment, looking thoughtful, then chuckles to herself before joining them. 

###.

James puts his arm around her shoulders for a brief moment, then rubs her back.

###.

A woman talking on a mobile phone while hanging out washing is distracted by the shrill sound.

###.

"No, I couldn't. I have to finish, really. No! What are you talking about? Of course yes, our luggage is ready..."

###.

"Listen, I cannot talk right now. I have to leave you." Zoe  - the next one...
