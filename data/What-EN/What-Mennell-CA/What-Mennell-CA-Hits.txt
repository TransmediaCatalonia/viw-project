AD-en	4530	15850	11320	It's an early grey morning at an urban seaside. A couple dressed in warm clothes walk their great dane as a lone jogger rambles past. The sidewalk in the foreground that runs alongside a road is vacant.
AD-en	19280	21530	2250	A title reads: What happens while BLANK.
AD-en	24090	32530	8440	A white two-door coupe pulls up in front of the sidewalk. It's driven by a man in his forties who wears a business suit. Talking on his cell phone, he gets out holding a briefcase.
AD-en	43540	44620	1080	He opens his trunk.
AD-en	53280	55380	2100	Hanging up, he looks towards the sea.
AD-en	59760	62920	3160	He dons aviator sunglasses and his shoulders relax.
AD-en	65300	67410	2110	A title reads: James. The Businessman.
AD-en	68120	70980	2860	Moments later he strolls with a beach bag as he makes a call.
AD-en	94150	97360	3210	Still later his suit is balled up beside a towel laid out on the sand.  01:34.17
AD-en	99020	108480	9460	James lies back with his shirt off . He closes his eyes then rubs them. Relaxing his arms to his sides, he runs his fingers through the sand and squints up at the sky.
AD-en	115090	115770	680	 He sits up.
AD-en	130170	131350	1180	He glances over his shoulders.
AD-en	141870	143590	1720	Then he searches the ground around him.
AD-en	158090	174800	16710	He looks inquisitively around his towel then stands and walks towards the water in his black boxer briefs. On the opposite side of the bay, a smokestack looms over a city blurred by the haze. With his back to the cityscape, James walks barefoot in the sand scanning the area.
AD-en	180580	183270	2690	Giving up he turns back towards his clothes.
AD-en	185320	190310	4990	He pauses then looks searchingly in the direction of the city as he ambles back to the water.
AD-en	196230	202470	6240	Then he makes his way to his clothes, still scanning the landscape around him in search of the source of the sound.
AD-en	209840	212310	2470	He pulls on his light blue button down shirt.
AD-en	219940	223250	3310	Later, with his suit jacket open, he strolls beneath tall trees.
AD-en	227110	231200	4090	Then he climbs a well worn dirt path up a slope of cactuses and brush.
AD-en	233510	235880	2370	Elsewhere, hands tap a take out coffee cup.
AD-en	238690	243560	4870	A man in his sixties has unruly grey hair and a thick beard. He has tired green eyes.
AD-en	245270	246270	1000	He shakes his head.
AD-en	249580	251690	2110	He taps his coffee lid before removing it.
AD-en	256170	259230	3060	He swirls the dark liquid then takes a swig.
AD-en	265260	287440	22180	A title reads: 'Rick: the retiree'.  He places the lid on the park bench beside him then blows on his coffee. His right leg twitches impatiently. Sitting in the shade he wears an army green tank top that exposes his black tattoos on his upper arms. He sets down his coffee then claps his hands impatiently. He grabs a smart phone from his back pocket.
AD-en	289850	291040	1190	He scrolls through his contacts.
AD-en	294970	298030	3060	Then, settling on "Craig Anderson", he makes a call.
AD-en	330260	331440	1180	He squints toward the sky.
AD-en	380700	382150	1450	He squints upwards again.
AD-en	397390	402330	4940	Leaving his coffee on the bench he scans the sky  before heading off down a gravel path.
AD-en	412560	419750	7190	Elsewhere a girl in her early twenties with thick curly red hair sits before a laptop. A title reads: 'Jess, the student.'
AD-en	426520	429630	3110	She searches for her phone beneath a pile of papers on her desk.
AD-en	493220	495800	2580	Hanging up she surveys the room around her.
AD-en	506360	508350	1990	Hearing the noise again she stands.
AD-en	511550	513820	2270	Later outside, she wears a jacket and scarf.
AD-en	517900	520250	2350	She hikes up an overgrown grassy slope.
AD-en	524780	528810	4030	Her head turns sharply at the sound and she rushes off behind some tall grasses.
AD-en	530150	534430	4280	Moments later she joins James and Rick on a sandy plateau atop the hill.
AD-en	537440	540530	3090	Standing apart from each other they look around in confusion.
AD-en	556000	561470	5470	Searching for the voice; Rick makes a questioning gesture and James shields his eyes from the sun.
AD-en	696580	697580	1000	Rick nods.
AD-en	708470	710360	1890	Rick shrugs and shakes his head.
AD-en	736820	739030	2210	Rick follows James towards the trees.
AD-en	740520	743330	2810	Jessica raises her eyebrow then grins.
AD-en	744620	749730	5110	She chases after the men and James puts his arm around her as they fall into step with each other.
AD-en	758160	759200	1040	All goes black.
AD-en	761470	765730	4260	A woman's on her phone and a subtitle reads, 'No, I couldn't. I have to finish, really.'
AD-en	767020	771570	4550	'No!' she says, 'What are you talking about? Of course yes, our luggage is ready.'
AD-en	772320	777450	5130	She looks for the sound, then says, 'Listen, I cannot talk right now. I have to leave you'.
AD-en	778550	780750	2200	A title reads, 'Zoe, the next one.'
AD-en	782570	786660	4090	all goes black then words on a screen read; What happens while BLANK.
