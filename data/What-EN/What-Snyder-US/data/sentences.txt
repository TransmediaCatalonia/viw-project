Under a partly-cloudy sky, a wide and sandy beachfront and parking area/ A jogger runs from the right, while at left a couple walks a large dog.

###.

A title: What happens While

###.

Emerging from a white sedan, a man with a trim, reddish-brown beard holds a phone to his ear and pulls a briefcase out of the car.

###.

Wearing a dark suit, his tie loose at the collar, he exchanges his briefcase for a striped cloth bag from the trunk.

###.

He glances toward the beach, pulls sunglasses from his coat’s vest pocket, and puts them on.

###.

A title: James, The Businessman/ Now, looking at his phone, he steps along the beachfront.

###.

A piece of clothing and a towel lie in the sand/ James lies back, naked from the waist up/ He rubs his eyes then fingers the sand.

###.

He looks side to side.

###.

He looks around himself.

###.

James stands, and wearing gray swim trunks, strolls toward the water but turns away and trudges on the sand several paces/ Finally, he turns back.

###.

He looks to both sides then moves on.

###.

He dons his shirt.

###.

Next, in his suit but without the tie, James strolls a tree-lined walkway/ Then, he climbs up a hill along a sandy path bordered by bushes and dry scrub.

###.

Now, a man taps the side of a coffee cup.

###.

He looks up and grins.

###.

He shakes his head.

###.

he traces the lid of his cup with a finger/ In a tank top and with a gold chain around his neck, the man has a salt-and-pepper beard and straggly, wind-blown hair.

###.

Removing the coffee cup lid, he sips from his coffee.

###.

Rick, The retiree.

###.

Seated in a chair between two other chairs, he puts down the lid while tapping his right foot swiftly/ Behind him, foliage and tall trees.

###.

He puts down the cup and claps his hands before retrieving a phone from his pocket.

###.

He scrolls through contacts and selects "Craig Anderson".

###.

Shakes his head.

###.

Looks up and side to side/ Knits his eyebrows.

###.

Moves his right hand back and forth.

###.

He looks around.

###.

Glancing to each side, Rick strolls along a concrete walkway, his coffee cup still on a bench.

###.

Next, with foliage in the background, a young woman with long, curly, red hair sits at a laptop and papers/ She brings a pencil end to her lips.

###.

Jess, The student.

###.

She rummages through her papers.

###.

Jess looks to both sides and up.

###.

Jess gathers her things.

###.

In a jacket and scarf, Jess steps up an embankment past tall grasses/ Turns abruptly, then continues on.

###.

Now, Jess, Rick, and James, all looking to the sky and around, meet on a stretch of sand.

###.

All three glance up and about, quizzical looks on their faces.

###.

James nods.

###.

His finger sways like a metronome.

###.

Rick nods.

###.

Rick shrugs and shakes his head/ Jess shakes her head.

###.

Arms outspread.

###.

James and Rick turn and step away.

###.

Jess joins them/ Their figures are tiny against the stretch of sand and foliage beyond.

###.

A woman on a phone, hanging laundry.

###.

No, I couldn’t/ I have to finish, really/ She looks up/ No/ What are you talking about/ Of cours yes, our luggage is ready/ She looks arround.

###.

Listen, I cannot talk right now/ I have to leave you.

###.

Zoe, the next one.

###.
